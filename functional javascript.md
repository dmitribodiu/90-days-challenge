# Becoming Functional
FP is based on producing the desired result by evaluating expressions built
out of functions that are `composed` together

We want our code to be:
    + modular
    + undertandable
    + testable
    + extensible
        Small changes shouldn't imply large, serious refactoring of your code.
    + reusable

FP gives us `all of that`.

- Not all is gold
    we want to use FP to simplify our coding, not to make it more complex
    so sometimes we may want to step off FP paradigm where we need it.
    
JavaScript isn't a purely functional language, but it has all the features
that we need for it to work as if it were:
    1. Functions as first-class objects
    2. recursion
    3. arrow functions
    4. closures
    5. spread operator
